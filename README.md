# Introduction to Recursion

Recursion is a powerful programming technique where a function calls itself in order to solve smaller instances of the same problem. This technique is commonly used to break down complex problems into simpler subproblems, and it is especially useful for tasks involving repeated operations, such as searching, sorting, and traversing data structures like trees and graphs.

## Key Concepts

1. **Base Case**: The condition under which the recursive function stops calling itself. Without a base case, the recursion would continue indefinitely, causing a stack overflow.

2. **Recursive Case**: The part of the function where it calls itself with a modified argument, usually a simpler or smaller problem.

3. **Stack**: Each recursive call creates a new frame on the call stack. Once the base case is reached, the recursion starts unwinding, and each frame is removed from the stack in reverse order.

## When to Use Recursion

Recursion is ideal for problems that have the following characteristics:

- A problem can be broken down into similar subproblems.
- The solution to the subproblems is easier to solve.
- The problem involves a natural hierarchical structure (e.g., tree traversal).

## Performance Considerations

Although recursion can be a very elegant solution, it is important to keep in mind that:

- Recursive calls can consume significant memory due to the call stack, especially for large inputs.
- Iterative solutions may be more efficient in certain cases, particularly when the recursion depth is large.
